# I AM THE BACKEND!
Have you ever used Advanced REST Client, or Edit & Resend in Firefox Developer Tools, or `curl`, and said "Wow, this is great! I sure wish I could go further and respond to the request, too!"

No? Oh...

Well, anyway, think of this as an "Advanced REST Server" - one where you can say "why modify the backend, or intercept the request, or monitor the system, when I AM the backend!?" and laugh maniacally like some kind of evil silicon magician.
